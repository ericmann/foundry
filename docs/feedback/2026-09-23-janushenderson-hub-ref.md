# Foundry flight feedback — janushenderson-hub-ref

Collected against plugin `foundry@ericmann` 0.3.1; addressed in
[`docs/plans/v0.3.2.md`](../plans/v0.3.2.md) (F-01–F-04) and
[`docs/plans/v0.4.md`](../plans/v0.4.md) (F-05) — every F-item below maps to
the task that closes it.

Pulled from that project's `.foundry/feedback.jsonl` with
`/foundry:pull-feedback`. Newest entries at the bottom.

## F-01 — the implement-guard stop hook blocks the go-flight controller

Logged by the flight controller (`stage: controller`, `category:
stop-hook`, round 0, at `2026-09-23T19:30:18.584Z`):

> The implement-guard stop hook fires on the go-flight controller session
> while the implementer subagent runs in the background, blocking every
> controller turn end with "call foundry_task_next" even though the
> controller must not run tasks itself. Each block counts toward guardCap;
> the controller has to hold its turn open with bounded waits instead.

## F-02 — the reviewer's agent fallback passed a full model id the Agent tool rejects

Logged by the flight controller (`stage: controller`, `category: restart`,
round 0, at `2026-09-23T20:38:11.617Z`):

> foundry_next returned agentFallback=true with model "claude-opus-5-5" for
> the reviewer, but the Agent tool's model parameter only accepts the
> aliases sonnet/opus/haiku/fable, so the fallback spawn failed with
> InputValidationError; foundry-reviewer was also not yet loadable (first
> population). Controller proceeded with the equivalent alias "opus".
> Suggest foundry_next emit the alias form when a full claude-* id maps to
> one.

## F-03 — `foundry_review_submit` returned counts taken before its own append

Logged by the reviewer (`stage: review`, `category: stale-output`, round 1,
at `2026-09-23T20:46:01.094Z`):

> foundry_review_submit (CHANGES REQUESTED, 3 fix tasks) returned counts
> {todo: 0, total: 26, open: 0} even though it had just appended
> R1-01..R1-03 as open checkboxes to PROGRESS.md. The counts look like they
> were taken before the append. It cost a re-check of PROGRESS.md/PLAN.md
> to confirm the tasks were actually recorded.

## F-04 — auto mode refused the reviewer's in-tree mutation testing

Logged by the reviewer (`stage: review`, `category: tool-refusal`, round 1,
at `2026-09-23T20:59:04.228Z`):

> review-build asks the reviewer to mutate source in the working tree and
> restore with git checkout, but the auto-mode classifier refused the
> in-tree edit as modifying shared resources. Had to fall back to a
> git-archive scratch copy, which can run unit tests but not the wp-env
> integration suite (wp-env maps the repo root), so integration mutations
> could only be reasoned statically.

## F-05 — the build plan was strictly sequential despite independent tasks

Logged by the planner (`stage: plan`, `category: parallelism`, round 1,
at `2026-09-23T21:07:00.568Z`):

> The build plan was strictly sequential (26 tasks, one implementer, ~68
> minutes wall clock) even though phases and tasks had independent file
> sets (e.g. docs scaffold, test spies, transport stubs, CLI shim). The
> planner should, where possible, carve tasks into parallel workstreams
> with disjoint Files touched, and the implement stage should run those
> streams concurrently in separate git worktrees (or similar) and merge
> them, so the whole phased plan is not serialized. Concurrent operations
> run concurrently; ship faster.
